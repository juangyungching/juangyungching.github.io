        <h1>Do you like it better to be in your home country? Or would you prefer to be in NYC?
        </h1>
        <p> I have two opinions about this question. Life in NYC had more freedom because I was able to live by myself. However, it is also good to be in my home country because it is a rare chance for me to have an opportunity to live in Korea.
